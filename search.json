    "text": "This workshop on measurement invariance (MI) and differential item functioning (DIF) is organized as follows:\n\nPart 1 addresses MI in the unidimensional factor model for categorical data. The focus is on various “levels” of MI that are obtained by imposing increasingly strict constraints on the model (e.g., configural, weak / metric, strong / scalar), and how these constraints can be tested using empirical data.\nPart 2 addresses what to do when MI is rejected. In this case, it can be concluded that one or more assessment items exhibit DIF, which is also referred to as partial MI. Methods for inferring which items exhibit DIF were originally developed in the context of item response theory (IRT) rather than factor analysis. This part of the workshop begins with a review of IRT, emphasizing its relationship with factor analysis for categorical data, and then discusses some traditional techniques for DIF analysis (the Mantel-Haenszel test and the likelihood ratio test). Emphasis is given to the problem of anchor item selection.\nPart 3 reviews of some more recent approaches to DIF analysis, focusing on the author’s work on how DIF can be approached as a problem in robust scaling (Halpin, 2022) and extensions of this approach to evaluate differential test functioning (DTF)."
